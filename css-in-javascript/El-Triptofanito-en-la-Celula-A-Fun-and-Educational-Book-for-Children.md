*El Triptofanito en la Celula* is a sequel to *El Triptofanito*, a book that follows the adventures of a little amino acid named Triptofanito and his friends as they travel through the human body. In this book, Triptofanito and his companions enter a cell and discover its amazing structure and functions. They meet different organelles, such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, the ribosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum, and learn about their roles in the cell. They also witness the processes of DNA replication, transcription, translation, and protein synthesis.
 
The book is written in a simple and engaging way, using dialogues and illustrations to explain complex concepts in a fun and easy way. The book is suitable for children of ages 10 and above, as well as for adults who want to refresh their knowledge of biology. The book also includes a glossary of terms and a list of references for further reading.

One of the most interesting parts of *El Triptofanito en la Celula* is when Triptofanito and his friends enter the nucleus and meet the DNA. They learn that DNA is the molecule that contains all the information for making proteins and that it is organized in units called genes. They also learn that DNA can be copied and passed on to new cells through a process called replication.
 
Another exciting part of the book is when Triptofanito and his friends witness how DNA is converted into RNA and then into proteins. They learn that this process involves two steps: transcription and translation. In transcription, an enzyme called RNA polymerase reads a segment of DNA and makes a complementary strand of RNA. In translation, another enzyme called ribosome reads the RNA and assembles a chain of amino acids according to the code. Triptofanito and his friends are amazed by the accuracy and speed of these processes.
 
The book also explains how proteins are modified and transported to different parts of the cell or outside the cell. Triptofanito and his friends visit the endoplasmic reticulum, where proteins are folded and modified, and the Golgi apparatus, where proteins are sorted and packaged. They also see how proteins are delivered to their destinations by vesicles, small membrane-bound sacs that move along the cytoskeleton.
